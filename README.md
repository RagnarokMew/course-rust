# qa-manual-course

This course is based on [ISTQB Certified Tester Foundation Level, CTFL](https://www.istqb.org/certifications/certified-tester-foundation-level-ctfl-v4-0/) v4.0.1 from 2024. You can access it at [ISTQB_CTFL_Syllabus_v4.0.1.pdf](ISTQB_CTFL_Syllabus_v4.0.1.pdf).  
That course is mostly theoretical, but we add practical examples after each chapter and weekly home assignments.

## Structure

- Will last for 6 weeks
- Each week, you'll read yourself one chapter from the above course
- Every week, we'll have a two h call where:
  - We discuss the chapter
  - Address any questions
  - Discuss practical examples
  - Check homework
  - Assign new homework

## How to submit your weekly home assignments

An example for the course of 2025:
- Make sure your GitHub account is added to this repo
- Locate your chapter homework issue in the [project](https://github.com/orgs/xoriors/projects/2). Let's say it's for [chapter 1](https://github.com/xoriors/qa-manual-course/issues/1)
- Fork the repo or create a new branch in this repo
- In your branch, add the needed files to complete the assignment
- Create a PR back to this repo for the `main` branch titled as the assignment issue title and including `#ID` too. Also, put a link to the assignment issue in the description of the PR.
  In this case, the title is `Course 1: Fundamentals of Testing #1`, and the link to add to the description is https://github.com/xoriors/qa-manual-course/issues/1
- Assign the PR to a reviewer
- Follow up on any comments and questions, pushing additional changes to the PR's branch until the PR is merged
