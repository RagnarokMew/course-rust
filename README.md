# course-rust

This course is based on [The Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). We also add more practical examples after each chapter and weekly assignments.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> **WORK IN PROGRESS**
> 
> The main idea of this repo is to give you, at a minimum:
> - A complete Rust course based on `The Rust Book`
> - Additional practical examples and assignments
> - Docs, logistics, a project, and GitHub issues to organize the course interactively
> - All this Free and Open Source (FOSS)

## Prerequesites

- You should be familiar with the basics of programming, algorithms and data structures
- It's expected you have some dev experience, preferably with any of C/C++, Go, Java, Kotlin, Python, Haskell, JavaScript, TypeSript or similar
- You are comfortable learning alone, and you should have taken other similar courses, such as self-paced ones, interactive, video courses, and document courses

## Structure

- Start on Feb 3 2025, with a short intro call
- Will last for 8 weeks + final project
- After 2 weeks, students will be able to build something like a simple calculator
- Each week, students will read a few chapters from `The Rust Book`
- Every week, we'll have a 2h call where we:
  - Discuss last week's assignment
  - Discuss the last week's chapter
  - Address any questions (this will happen also over the week via Slack or GitHub issues)
  - Discuss practical examples
  - Give a new assignment for last week's chapter
- Everything will be video recorded and made available in this repo for anybody to use
