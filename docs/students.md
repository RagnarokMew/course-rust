## How to submit your weekly home assignments

An example for the course of 2025:
- Make sure your GitHub account is added to this repo
- Locate your chapter homework issue in the [project](https://github.com/orgs/xoriors/projects/2). Let's say it's for [chapter 1](https://github.com/xoriors/qa-manual-course/issues/1)
- Fork the repo or create a new branch in this repo
- In your branch, add the needed files to complete the assignment
- Create a PR back to this repo for the `main` branch titled as the assignment issue title and including `#ID` too. Also, put a link to the assignment issue in the description of the PR.
  In this case, the title is `Course 1: Fundamentals of Testing #1`, and the link to add to the description is https://github.com/xoriors/qa-manual-course/issues/1
- Assign the PR to a reviewer
- Follow up on any comments and questions, pushing additional changes to the PR's branch until the PR is merged
