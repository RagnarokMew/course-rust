## How to submit your weekly home assignments

### One time

- Make sure your GitHub account is added to this repo
- Fork the repo or create a new branch in this repo

### For each assignment

- Locate your chapter homework GitHub issue in the course project. Let's say it's the [course of 2025](https://github.com/orgs/xoriors/projects/2) for [chapter 1](https://github.com/xoriors/qa-manual-course/issues/1)
- In the assignment branch, add the needed files to complete the assignment
- Create a PR back to this repo for the `main` branch titled as the assignment issue title and including `#ID` too. Also, put a link to the assignment issue in the description of the PR.
  In this case, the title is `Course 1: Fundamentals of Testing #1`, and the link to add to the description is https://github.com/xoriors/qa-manual-course/issues/1
- Assign the PR to a reviewer
- Follow up on any comments and questions, pushing additional changes to the PR's branch until the PR is merged

## Final project

- After the course is finished, the course project will have a final project assignment. Please complete that based on your availability and ask any questions in the issue or on Slack
- While working on it, please follow the steps from [How to submit your weekly home assignments](#how-to-submit-your-weekly-home-assignments)
